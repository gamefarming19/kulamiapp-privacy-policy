    <h1>KULAMI Scoring App Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [May 20, 2025]</strong></p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application KULAMI Scoring App ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ali & Emine . By using the Application, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access and Process</h2>
    <p>The Application requests the following permissions to access and process data to perform its core functionalities. <strong>The Application does NOT send any of this data to any external servers or share it with third parties. All processing occurs solely on your device.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Camera Access:</strong> The Application requests access to your camera to allow you to take a picture of the KULAMI game board for scoring purposes. The captured image is processed (momentarily) on your device for scoring. This image is not stored by the Application on your device nor sent to our servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gallery Access (Read External Storage Permission):</strong> The Application requests permission to read your external storage (gallery) to allow you to select a previously taken picture of the KULAMI game board for scoring. The selected image is processed momentarily on your device for scoring. This image is not stored by the Application on your device nor sent to our servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Write External Storage Permission (Optional Feature):</strong> The Application may use the write external storage permission solely at your explicit request to save a screenshot of the scoring result to your device's gallery. This feature is not used unless actively initiated by you, and the saved screenshot is under your control.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Application does not collect any other personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, location, etc.).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Images accessed from the camera or gallery are used momentarily and solely on your device for the KULAMI game scoring algorithm to function and display the score result to you.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>No user data (images, scoring results, or other personal information) processed by our Application is shared with third parties or external servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>The Application does not retain any images or scoring results it processes to perform its function (except for screenshots saved to the gallery at your explicit request).</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here.
